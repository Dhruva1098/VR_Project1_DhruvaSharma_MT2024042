# Face Mask Detection, Classification, and Segmentation

**Project Report for VR Mini Project 1**

**Total Marks:** 15  
**Deadline:** 24th March

---

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on developing a computer vision solution to detect, classify, and segment face masks in images. The work involves two main components:  
- **Classification:** Determining whether a face is wearing a mask or not.
- **Segmentation:** Precisely localizing and outlining the mask regions.

Two approaches are implemented:
- **Traditional Machine Learning with Handcrafted Features** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for binary classification.
- **Traditional Region-based Segmentation Techniques** and a deep learning approach using **U-Net** for mask segmentation.

## 2. Dataset

Two public datasets are used in this project:

- **Face Mask Detection Dataset:**  
  Source: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/chandrikadeb7/Face-Mask-Detection/tree/master/dataset)  
  Structure: Contains images labeled as "with mask" and "without mask" for binary classification.

- **Masked Face Segmentation Dataset (MFSD):**  
  Source: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sadjadrz/MFSD)  
  Structure: Provides images and corresponding ground truth masks for the segmentation task.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Binary Classification Using Handcrafted Features and ML Classifiers

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  Handcrafted features (e.g., Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Patterns) are extracted from the images.

- **Model Training:**  
  Two machine learning classifiers are trained:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Neural Network (using a simple MLP architecture)**

- **Evaluation:**  
  The classifiers are evaluated using accuracy metrics. The results are compared to determine the best performing model.

### 3.2 Binary Classification Using CNN

- **Model Design:**  
  A custom Convolutional Neural Network is designed to perform binary classification.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Experiments include varying:
  - Learning rate
  - Batch size
  - Optimizer selection (e.g., Adam, SGD)
  - Activation function in the final classification layer

- **Comparison:**  
  The CNN’s performance is compared with the ML classifiers using overall accuracy.

### 3.3 Region Segmentation Using Traditional Techniques

- **Segmentation Method:**  
  A region-based segmentation method is implemented using:
  - Thresholding to differentiate mask regions from the face
  - Edge detection techniques (e.g., Canny edge detector) to refine segmentation boundaries

- **Visualization:**  
  The segmentation results are visualized alongside the original images to evaluate the effectiveness of the method.

#### Notebook Results

### 3.4 Mask Segmentation Using U-Net

- **Model Training:**  
  A U-Net model is trained on the MFSD dataset for detailed mask segmentation.

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  The U-Net segmentation results are evaluated using:
  - Intersection over Union (IoU)
  - Dice Score

- **Comparison:**  
  The performance of U-Net is compared with the traditional segmentation techniques.

## 4. Hyperparameters and Experiments

### CNN Hyperparameters

- **Learning Rates:** Explored values ranged from 0.001 to 0.01.  
- **Batch Sizes:** Experimented with batch sizes of 16, 32, and 64.  
- **Optimizers:** Adam and SGD were compared.  
- **Activation Functions:** Variations in the classification layer (ReLU vs. softmax) were tested.

### U-Net Hyperparameters

- **Input Resolution:** Experiments with different image sizes were conducted.
- **Loss Functions:** Dice loss and binary cross-entropy were compared.
- **Epochs and Batch Size:** The training was run over 50 epochs with a batch size of 16, adjusting learning rate based on performance.

Detailed experimental logs, parameter settings, and performance metrics are provided in the notebook, ensuring reproducibility.

## 5. Results and Evaluation

### Classification

- **ML Classifiers:**  
  The SVM and Neural Network achieved competitive accuracy, with detailed comparisons showing slight improvements for the neural network under specific feature sets.

- **CNN:**  
  The CNN model outperformed the ML classifiers in most configurations, particularly with optimized hyperparameters.  
  *Overall Accuracy:* ~92%

### Segmentation

- **Traditional Methods:**  
  Provided a baseline segmentation, but suffered in cases of low contrast and noisy images.

- **U-Net:**  
  Achieved higher IoU and Dice scores, indicating more precise segmentation.  
  *Average IoU:* ~0.85  
  *Dice Score:* ~0.88

A tabular summary of key metrics is shown below:
